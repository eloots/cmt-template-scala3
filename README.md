# Scala 3 course CMT template

This is a three exercise template for a scala 3 course:

- The first exercise is a "Hello, World" app
- The second exercise is about calculating the sum
  of prime numbers and requires the students to 'pull'
  in code to generate prime numbers
- The third exercise is about decomposing a given
  integer number into its prime factors
